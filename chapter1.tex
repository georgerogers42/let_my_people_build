Free my people from the tyranny of Urban Growth Boundaries, Zoning, and Building Codes!
Let them build a city that is driven by the market, not the whims of rich political elites, at the expense of the poor!
The poor and middle class in this country are held down by excessive regulation at every level of politics from  City Hall all the way up to Washington DC.
This book will describe the ways City Hall harms the poor and middle class to benefit itself!

If you answered any of the items: A, B, C, or D; you are both wrong and part of the problem!
For if you think you have identified the problem---but incorrectly---you are the problem!

Let us go through the alleged culprits and show why they are not the problem but actually the solution!
\startsubsection[title={Developers}]
A honest developer (which were all developers---before you screwed up the housing market! and are the developers you are against!) makes money by building housing.
Therefore demonizing developers for building housing for rich people makes the problem worse by making sure less housing is built! This in turn leads to more demonization, which leads to the doubling down on stupid!

This is in contrast to Texas and especially Houston, which are an honest developers paradise!
These markets have a rubber stamp permitting process which increases supply of housing leading to lower costs!
\stopsubsection
\startsubsection[title={Rich Foreigners and Newcomers}]
These people provide the money for developers to make more housing which makes housing cheaper.
Also rich people have to live somewhere!
